### Capstone Statement
This app sets the framework for future versions where it will allow users to track spaceship combat for the Starfinder tabletop game. 

It currently allows users to create an account with an encrypted password, then log and and view their 'Hangar' page that shows a list of all their ships. They can create a new ship and customize the parts, or click on any existing ship to enter the customization page.

On the 'Customization' page, all changes selected from the dropdown menu are automatically saved to the database. These changes are returned and displayed, showing the selected part name and displaying the new cost.
